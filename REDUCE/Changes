     Please record ALL functional changes to the Hamilton reduction software
here and at the beginning of all affected routines.  -JAV

30-Mar-98 JAV  hamsrc.pro
  Analysis: The user library distributed with IDL now includes a routine
    named "trace.pro" which contains a function to compute the trace of a
    matrix. This naming degeneracy with the "trace.pro" in the reduction
    package can lead to the wrong routine being compiled, depending on the
    order of directories in IDL_PATH. If the wrong routine is compiled, the
    reduction package will halt with an "undefined procedure or function"
    error message.
  Solution: To avoid the naming conflict, trace.pro in the reduction package
    was renamed hamtrc.pro with a corresponding change in the name of the
    procedure contained therein. Throughout the package, calls to "trace"
    were replaced by calls to "hamtrc". The following routines were affected:
    backgd, blaze, cformat, deblaze, exafc, exorc, falspk, fitarcs, flatim,
    fndpks, fords, getarc, getbkg, getimage, getorc, getspec, gettrof,
    getxwd, hamdord, hamflat, hamspec, hamtrc, hotpix, igetarc, locate,
    maskbox, maskim, normflat, ospace

09-Feb-98 CMJ  getimage.pro
  Analysis:    See next entry.
  Solution:    Added ClipBias logic to handle McDonald data and therefore
    the procedure rectify is no longer needed.  NOTE: So far, routines
    such as sumfits will not yet work on IRAF written FITS files since
    this program does not use rdfits.pro.

09-Feb-98 CMJ  rdfits.pro
  Analysis:    rdfits.pro generally fails to read in IRAF written fits files
    properly.  The old solution was to use rectify.pro to read them in
    with the Goddard readfits.pro routine and then write them out with 
    wtfits before the reudction process.  Rectify.pro also subtracted 
    the mean of the overscan off McDonald images which is a good estimate 
    of the bias.  However, the scaling in wfits actually caused a slight 
    loss of information.
  Solution:    rdfits is now a driver for readfits.pro.  You can select /old
    to implement the old version of rdfits.pro.  All of the old functionality
    of rdfits.pro is reserved, so it should be a transparent change.  Also
    added some capabilities, such as clipbias keyword to do wht rectify does
    and therefore bypass the need for rectify.pro to even be run.

29-Oct-97 CMJ  hamset.pro, cformat.pro, maskim.pro
  Analysis:    A new Lick dewar has been added to the reduction package.
    This is a new 2048 chip installed in the old dewar #6.  The format
    of the spectrum is reversed along columns from the old Lick dewars.
  Solution:    Added this dewar as id = 6.2 to the reduction package and
    created a mask for it based on a wide flat exposure.

28-Oct-97 CMJ  backgd.pro, bckgrc.pro, exafc.pro, exorc.pro, fitarcs.pro,
               ospace.pro, and quadex.pro
  Analysis:    See immediately below for fords.pro.  Concern is that 
    poly_fit could not work properly in many situations without the 
    /double keyword.
  Solution:    Add /double keyword to all poly_fit calls.

28-Oct-97 CMJ  fords.pro
  Analysis:   Fords was continually failing on Hamilton 2048X2048 chip
    data, returning NaN for all the values of the order location 
    coefficients as well as arithmetic floating point errors.  Eventually
    problem was traced to IDL routine poly_fit returning NaN if the
    /double keyword is not supplied under certain circumstances.
  Solution:   Add the /double keyword to all poly_fit calls in fords.

27-Mar-97 CMJ,JAV  sumfits.pro
  Analysis:   Using sumfits on CSHELL spectra did not produce the same sum
    as when reading the images in separately and then adding them.  It
    turns out sumfits.pro assumed that the data started right after the
    endcard, but this is non standard.  CSHELL spectra are padded with
    zeros after the endcard to reach a multiple of 2880.
  Solution:   Added logic to size of HSList in sumfits which forced it
    to force the data to begin after a multiple of 2880.

01-Nov-95 CMJ  wtfits.pro
  Analysis:  Some of my fits images come with no BSCALE or BZERO cards in
    their headers if there was no unusual scaling done.  Wtfits.pro would
    then abort on these images during normal processing.
  Solution:  Modified the tests for these.  If no cards detected, it prints
    a warning, then adds new cards with BSCALE = 1.0, BZERO = 0.0 and continues.

01-Nov-95 CMJ  hamset.pro, maskim.pro, exorc.pro, cformat.pro
  Analysis:  Needed some additional processing steps for McDonald 2.7-m
    coude echelle spectra with the TK3 chip at the R=60,000 focus.
  Solution:  Created dewar 34.1 specifications to identify this combination.
    The needed modifications to each routine were added, the most significant
    of which is adjust nadd in exorc.pro for this setup since the orders 
    curve substantially more in this configuration than in other supported
    setups.

23-Aug-95 CMJ  addcard.pro
  Analysis:  All my coadded images from the first McDonald run with TK3 were
    shifted improperly and the headers for these files read in by rdfits.pro
    were not multiples of 2880 bytes long.
  Solution:  Found that addcard.pro does not move the END card to the last 
    header card when it has to add 36 blank cards to an already full header.  
    This in turn upsets rdfits.pro inits read.  Added logic to addcard.pro so 
    that when it adds a block of 36 blank cards to the end of the header, it 
    moved the END card to the end of the new header.

22-Aug-95 CMJ  Routines as listed below.
  Analysis:  Added the McDonald 2.7m 2dcoude spectrometer with the TK3 chip
    to the list of dewars handled by the reduction package.  A number of minor
    adjustments needed to be made to the code to enable this and our listed
    here.
  Solution:  The following routines were altered -
    1.) hamset.pro - added the TK3 dewar to the list as dewar 34.
    2.) getimage.pro - added dewar 34 and set clipbase = 32 for this dewar.
    3.) cformat.pro - added dewar 34 to code and specify reversing the
          orders at the end so wavelength runs letf to right (blue to red) 
          in each order in the reduced spectra.
    4.) maskim.pro - added dewar 34 and secified to regions of bad columns
          in the mask.

19-Jul-95 CMJ  getarc.pro
  Analysis:  Using getarc to "manually" extract orders from an image in
    which fords had found 27 orders, I found that the routine would not
    let me attempt an extraction on orders 26, 27, and 0.  Inspecting
    getspec.pro showed that it creates the extended order coefficients to
    enable getarc.pro to work properly in this situation.
  Solution:  Modified getarc.pro to igetarc.pro to allow extraction without
    first creating extended order coefficients.  To do so I
    increased the variable maxo by one and adjusted logic on the
    test at the begining of the awid lt 1 section to allow it to operate
    on the top two orders.  Adjusted indexing in this section to have the
    routine bound the requested order and added checks to see if the requested
    order is the first or last which then require an extrapolation of the 
    orcs instead of an interpolation.  This is mainly useful when "manually"
    inspecting images and bypasses the need to create extended order
    coefficients outside of the program.  Note that it references orders from
    1 to nord.

07-Feb-95 CMJ  exorc.pro
  Analysis:  exorc.pro was unable to add enough orders to cover the top of 
    the AIS chip from the 2.7m at McDonald.  Not enough extrapolated orders
    were being attempted.
  Solution:  Added the ham.common variables to the code and have it check to
    see if the AIS chip is being used (dewar 32).  If so, change nadd to 6
    which lets it try enough extrapolated orders to do the job.

07-Feb-95 CMJ  getimage.pro
  Analysis:  Examination of the ytrim section of the code indicated that the
    tests done there to see if the requested trim was a subset of the image
    found that the routine was checking against the number of columns, not the
    number of rows.  
  Solution:  replaced ncol by nrow and made nrow equal to the number of rows.

06-Feb-95 CMJ  getorc.pro
  Analysis:  If fords fails to find orders on narrow flat, it attempts to
    calculate a shift between the current image and dorc which is set to 0.
    This causes the package to end ungracefully and makes it casually look as if
    it found the orders.
  Solution:  Added logic to shift section of getorc.pro so that if the 
    current image is the narrow flat, getorc will not attempt the shift if
    fords.pro fails.

06-Feb-95 CMJ  Reduction Package
  These changes were made on 06-Feb-1995 as part of an effort to include
    data from the 2.7m coude echelle at McDonald Observatory in the list of
    instruments reduceable by the Hamilton reduction package.  The following
    changes were made:
    1.)  hamset.pro - Differentiate the 2.1m and 2.7m dewar id numbers.  
         Dewar 30 refers to the 2.1m cass echelle, dewar 32 refers to the
         2.7m coude echelle with the AIS chip.
    2.)  getimage.pro - Adjusted for better handling of McDonald data.  ClipBase
         will be set to 32 for dewar 30 (2.1m) and will be 0 for dewar
         32 (2.7m AIS).  Dewar 32 also requires a transpose operation.
    3.)  hamspec.pro - Before saving extracted spectrum, test for McDonald 
         dewars and call cformat.pro if present.  Both dewars need to have
         the orders reversed and dewar 30 needs to have the ordering of the
         orders reversed.
    4.)  cformat.pro - Created routine to put the McDonald data on the same
         format as the Hamilton data so that rdisp.pro and wdisp.pro work
         properly on McDonald data.

06-Feb-95 CMJ  Reduction Package
  These changes were made mostly in December 1994 as part of an effort to
    adapt the Hamilton reduction package to work with Sandiford Cass. Echelle
    data from the 2.1-meter telescope at McDonald Observatory.  The following
    changes were made:
    1.)  rdfits.pro - Allow ClipBase to be any integer and that number of 
         columns are removed from the end (need 32 for McD Cass Echelle).  
         Created a bias keyword that can be used if such info is not properly
         retrieved from FITS header (typically 5300 for Cass Echelle).
    2.)  hamdord.pro, hamspec.pro, hamflat.pro - all of these had the value
         of ClipBase (see above) set to 32 to handle this data.  This has
         since been overridden and is handled through dewar id numbers.
    3.)  rectify.pro, rectifyall.pro - Created routines to preprocess 
         McDonald data.  These fix the strnage IRAF handling of very high
         pixel values.  Also, allows for bias determination of the 2.1m
         spectra which are then subtracted off.
    4.)  wtfits.pro - Modify test for header length to warn that original 
         violated fits standard and to pad it out if it just lacks the proper
         number of cards.  The written fits file should be proper.
         Assumption is that last real card is EndCard and it will be
         placed at the end (true for Sandiford Cass. Echelle).
    5.)  locate.pro - If dewar spacings not known, program now warns and assumes
         obase=80 and continues instead of ending execution.
    6.)  Moved backgound determination code to routine GETBKG in order
         to facilitate interchanging Jeff's method with Gibor's by
         changing what routine to use.  GETBKG is Jeff's trough
         method.  BCKGRC is Gibor's method using contf to do a more
         global fit.  I prefer GETBKG and use of the 2.5arcsec decker
         correction for Hamilton images.  Currently, the choice is harwired
         into the code.

29-Aug-94 JAV	fords.pro
  Analysis: Geoff Marcy reported (in February) that a bug in the code
    caused the "Too many missing peaks" error to occur when analyzing
    Keck spectra, in which the orders curve differently than they do
    in the Hamilton.
  Solution: The logic in the code was corrected, so that now missing
    peaks are allowed within four orders of the last order, rather
    than only in the fourth order from the end.

06-Jul-94 JAV, CMJ   getarc.pro
  Analysis:  The number of pixels mashed along each column returned by
    the routine was approximately half what was expected when giving a
    fractional extraction width.  An endelse was misplaced in the
    program causing the lower boundary of all orders to be determined
    as if the extraction width was given in pixels.  Therefore all
    spectra reduced since about Apr 93 and possibly "all" spectra
    reduced with getarc using a fractional extraction width only pulled
    out a little over half the available signal.
  Solution:  Moved the endelse command to the appropriate place.

06-Jul-94 CMJ   getorc.pro
  Analysis:  The shifts found by correlating the observation with the
    default order locations were in error upon visual inspection.  This
    was caused by the routine using a subset of the image centered 2/3
    of the way over in columns where there happened to be some very hot
    pixels which were by far the stronegst thing in the TTS spectra I
    was looking at.  The cross correlation was driven by these hot
    pixels instead of the orders and so the resulting shifts were
    bogus.
  Solution:  First I made the routine use a subset of the image
    centered in 1/2 of the way over in cloumns since the spectra tend
    to be better exposed there in our settings and using the middle
    will help lessen the effects of any shape change of the orders
    between the spectra and the narrow flat.  To handle hot column
    problems, the routine now divides up the resulting image array
    (essentially a column plot) into sveral bins and finds the mean and
    standard deviation of each segment.  All pixels in this array whose
    value is greater than mean+4*stdev are set equal to mean+4*stdev
    where I use the minimal values of mean and stdev from the upper
    half of the chip.  This will cut the top off some real orders but
    will maintain there general shape and location which is what is
    critical for this process.

27-Apr-94 JAV	backgd.pro
  Analysis: No symptoms in reduced spectra. An examination of backgd.pro
    revealed that when ham_bg is 1, the contamination fraction ("cfrac")
    goes negative for orders bluer than order 121. This leads to inferred
    backgrounds higher than the trough levels. This is inconsistent,
    however, with the motivation for the contamination correction,
    which envisions troughs that are spuriously enhanced above true
    background levels by light from the adjacent orders. Contamination
    corrections should only correct the background level downwards.
  Solution: No change was made to the contamination correction applied
    redward of order 122. Blueward of this limit the contamination
    correction ("cfrac") is set to zero, which is equivalent to applying
    no correction.

29-Apr-94 CMJ modified GETORC to test for an overall shift in the order 
locations. For some reason the narrow flat does not always end up where the
stars do, sometimes by 3 pixels. Test for order locations is done in the 
center of the frame. No rotation is tested for. A new TRACE comment occurs.

20-Apr-94 CMJ, JAV  colfit.pro
  Analysis: colfit.pro crashes with a segmentation fault during a
    call_external to r4spline.so.  We believe this is a result of the
    upgrade to Solaris.
  Solution: Replace call_externals with calls to fspline.pro which calls
    spline.so.

29-Jan-94 JAV	locate.pro
  Analysis: Automatic order base determination has not been implemented
    yet for dewar 13. Current scheme of including in the routine a large
    vector of canonical spacings for each dewar is cumbersome.
  Solution: Automatic order base determination has been implemented for
    dewar 13. Polynomial fit coefficients are included in the program,
    rather than vector lists of canonical spacings.

28-Jan-94 JAV   fords.pro
  Analysis: Reduced big chip spectra show large scale ripples in their
    continua. The ripples have six nodes, one near the left edge, one
    near the right edge, and 4 equally spaced across the middle. The
    position of these nodes is identical for all orders. The amplitude
    of the ripples can be as large as 15% of the continuum (especially
    in the blue), varies from order to order, and varies from one
    observation to the next. The variations in amplitude seems random.
    These continuum ripples are actually depressions in the continuum
    caused by errors in the polynomial fits to the order locations,
    which oscillate about the true locations of the order peaks. The
    amplitude of these oscillations can be as large as 0.15 pixel. As
    the fit location wanders off a true peak, the continuum is
    depressed.  The errors in the order location fits are due to
    numerical precision limitations in poly_fit. This problem will
    probably also affect small chip reductions, as these too use a
    sixth order polynomial.
  Solution: The mean row number is subtracted from the peak locations
    for each order, prior to the polynomial fit. The mean is then added
    back in to the constant term in the deduced coefficients. The
    resulting order coefficients can be interpreted as before.

17-Jul-93 JAV  wdisp.pro
  Analysis: Writing a spectrum with bscale=0 (which occurs when all pixels
    in an order have exactly the same value), leads to a divide by zero
    error.
  Solution: Logic in wdisp now handles constant orders as a special case.
    Rdisp works in all cases without modification.

6-Jul-93 GB  maskim.pro
  Analysis: The chip in dewar 13.3 was destroyed in May of 1993. Hamilton
    data obtained after this date require a new mask.
  Solution: Maskim now has a rough mask for the new chip, which will be
    known as dewar 13.4.

13-May-93 JAV	addcard.pro
  Analysis: When attempting to write a 2048x2048 summed Hamilton image to
    disk, an "ADDCARD: Putative FITS header does not have an END card"
    error occurs. Addcard expects the "END" in the END card to be followed
    by spaces. The Lick headers (from 1991 at least) have a comment
    beginning at character 32 in the END card.
  Solution: Addcard now examines only the first 30 characters of each
    header card searching for the END card.

30-Mar-93 JAV	wtfits.pro, rdfits.pro, coadd.pro, cosmic.pro
  Analysis: Rdfits is returning garbage, when trying to read Lick images
    that were archived by the mountain crew, restored to disk at Lick,
    and then written to tape again. At some point in this process, BSCALE
    was changed from the usual value of 1. The scaling transformation
    {Image = ScaledImage/BSCALE + BZERO} used in the FITS handling
    routines is nonstandard (and hence wrong).
  Solution: The FITS handling routines now use the standard FITS scaling
    transformation {Image = ScaledImage*BSCALE + BZERO}. Logic was added
    in the reading routines to detect nonstandard scaling tranformations
    used by older versions of wtfits. Rdfits will correctly read the old
    files, while cosmic and coadd abort with a descriptive error. Comment
    cards written to the header by wtfits have been modified. They now
    include a description of the transformation used. Wtfits now calls
    addcard to add new comment cards to the FITS header. Coadd has been
    renamed sumfits to avoid confusion with IDL's internal coadd()
    function.

10-Mar-93 JAV	exafc.pro
  Analysis: Exafc is failing with "Attempt to subscript JXO ... is out of
    range" error for binned big chip solar flare spectra. Extrapolated arc
    fit coefficients for the bottom of the image are not being inserted
    properly into xafc. The insertion point is miscalculated. The offset
    depends on the number of orders extrapolated off the top of the chip.
    This is *assumed* to be equal to the number of orders extrapolated
    off the bottom of the chip. This was true until 25-Nov-92, but is no
    longer true.
  Solution: The number of orders extrapolated off the top of the chip is
    now retained in naddtop and is used in determining the insertion point
    into exafc.

23-Feb-93 JAV	cosmic.pro
  Analysis: Cosmic is failing with a "divide by zero" or "floating illegal
    operand" error, followed by a cascade of additional errors. The median
    is determined for each stack of pixels. The square root of this median
    appears in the denominator of two expressions. With the corrected FITS
    scaling logic of 5-Sep-92, this median is now occasionally negative,
    leading to the observed failure mode.
  Solution: Instead of dividing by the square root of median pixel value,
    we now divide by the square root of _the absolute value of_ the median
    pixel value.

26-Feb-93 JAV	fitshd.pro
  Analysis: Apparently, the KAST spectrograph FITS headers have 110 cards.
    Fitshd expects the header to be no longer than two 2880-byte FITS
    records or 2*36 (=72) 80-byte FITS headers cards.
  Solution: The maximum header size has been doubled to four 2880-byte
    FITS records or 4*36 (=144) 80-byte header cards.

21-Jan-93 JAV	fords.pro
  Analysis: The behavior of fords has changed for "Big Trim" spectra binned
    2x2. The reddest order found is now 59, rather than 58. The change of
    12-Dec-92 is causing order 58 to be discarded, even though it is just
    barely fully contained on the chip. There is really no reason the edge
    troughs shouldn't be allowed to extend all the way to the edges of the
    chip, especially since extraction rarely extends all the way to the
    trough.
  Solution: The first and last orders are now retained if their bounding
    troughs lie on the chip. The bounding troughs no longer need to be
    at least "poff" pixels from the edge.

12-Dec-92 JAV	fords.pro
  Analysis: I've forgotten the symptoms which led to the following analysis.
    The reddest order returned by fords was too close to the top edge of the
    chip. Although the peak of the reddest order never got within "poff" of
    the top edge, the extraction width extended beyond the edge. Poff was
    being used for two different purposes. Poff is 4/ham_bin, meaning that
    4/ham_bin pixels above and below each order peak are used to determine
    the exact location of the peak. Poff was also being used as the closest
    an order peak could come to the edge of the chip. There is no value of
    poff that makes sense for both applications.
  Solution: The location of the trough above the reddest order is estimated
    by linearly extrapolating (by half the order spacing) the peak locations
    of the first two orders  If this trough is less than "poff" pixels from
    the edge of the chip, then the order is discarded. A similar test is
    applied to the bluest order.

29-Nov-92 JAV	getorc.pro
  Analysis: Getxwd.pro failed on a binned, dewar 13.3 narrow flat. Subscript
    was out of range for variable "swa". Bad subscript due to bad order
    location coefficients (orc). In the top corners of the chip, the orders
    are closely spaced and are curving rapidly across rows. Because of this
    curvature, fords.pro lost track of one order and eventually locked on to
    the adjacent order.
  Solution: Reduce the width of the vertical swaths (swid), so as to better
    track the curvature of the orders. Since the problem occured with binned
    spectra, divide by the binning factor (ham_bin). This doesn't affect
    unbinned spectra (ham_bin=1), but doubles the number of vertical swaths
    in binned spectra (ham_bin=2). So for binned spectra, fords will take
    twice as long, will have half the faint-spectrum sensitivity, but it
    will work.

  Changed transformation from ScIm = Bscale * (Im + Bzero) to
  ScIm = Bscale * (Im - Bzero) to match changes in rdfits.pro.

18-Aug-92 JAV	exafc.pro
  Added ncol argument. Extrapolate counts in end arcs and then

  in fitarcs (fit is now vs. col/100.0, instead of just col).

17-Aug-92 JAV	exorc.pro
  New logic: fit to extrapolated order locations, rather than
  extrapolating fits to order locations. Works much better.
